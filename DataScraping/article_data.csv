To date, the focus and necessary foundation of climate plans has been the emissions produced by activities within city boundaries, as measured by a sector-based greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. However, this misses a key source of cities’ total emissions: consumption of imported goods and services. To avoid climate breakdown, over the next decade leading cities’ emissions must be cut by two-thirds, including the emissions driven by urban demand.1
Cities have an essential role to play in cutting the emissions embodied in the products and services we consume, from food to building materials. Why your city should work towards sustainable urban consumption explains the significance of consumption emissions and the local benefits of action to address them. This article explains the steps urban policymakers can take, along with emerging and tried-and-tested approaches in key urban consumption sectors.
Understand your city’s consumption-based emissions
Conduct a consumption-based emissions inventory (CBEI), if possible. A CBEI measures the city’s consumption footprint. The findings will enable the city to understand in detail the most significant sources of consumption-based emissions and to design effective strategies to reduce them. Cities including Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, Paris and London have already developed CBEIs.
A CBEI accounts for the total lifecycle emissions of goods and services consumed within the city – those produced within city boundaries as well as those imported from elsewhere. While cities’ sector-based emissions inventories are supported by the Global Protocol standardised framework, there is not yet an equivalent standardised framework for assessing consumption-based emissions. Nevertheless, SEI’s Estimating consumption-based GHG emissions at the city scale offers advice.
A detailed, city-level CBEI is not critical. Your city can begin to work to reduce consumption-based emissions without one – many cities are already doing so – and a CBEI can be established later. To get started, cities can source data, use indicators, and seek out any academic studies and assessments by national governments or other cities, for example, that might help to paint a picture of the likely sources of your city’s consumption emissions. Stockholm, for instance, has used national calculations of consumption emissions from Statistics Sweden and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.2
Cutting GHG emissions from consumption: Indicators are tools for action shares learning from London and New York City on how cities can use indicators to plan and measure actions to cut consumption emissions, in place of or in addition to a CBEI. It includes sample ‘actionable data indicators’ for sectors including food, buildings, transportation and products such as electronics and appliances.
Portland, OR has shared its data and learning in our interactive data story
Portland was among the first cities to develop a CBEI. The city found that 62% of its carbon dioxide emissions from consumption were created in the production phase of products and services, rather than transportation or use, which often receive more attention. The biggest source of consumption emissions in Portland is the use of vehicles in the city, which is already covered in Portland’s sector-based emissions inventory and earlier climate planning. New priority sectors that emerge from Portland’s consumption-based approach include food, services and healthcare, construction and other consumer goods.3
Set targets and goals for consumption-based emissions
Targets and goals for consumption-based emissions are important for guiding strategic planning and decision-making, improving accountability and communicating the direction of travel to businesses and the public. Targets for reducing emissions from consumption are usually set alongside those for sector-based emissions.
There is a currently strong positive correlation between GDP and per capita consumption-based emissions, which must be accounted for in targets and trajectories – and ultimately uncoupled.4 Fair distribution of science-based global GHG budgets means that wealthier cities with high per capita consumption emissions should take the lead and strive to reduce emissions from consumption urgently and rapidly.5
Cities that have published strategies targeting emissions from urban consumption include:
The 2018 Paris Climate Action Plan. As well as halving sector-based emissions by 2030, Paris is aiming to reduce consumption emissions – which it calls the Paris carbon footprint – by 40% in the same timeframe, en route to net zero by 2050. The plan includes action to tackle imported emissions in the food and construction sectors and from transport outside Paris, including air transport.
The Portland Climate Action Plan 2015. Portland, Oregon is aiming to half emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, targeting both sector- and consumption-based emissions. The plan’s 20 objectives include encouraging sustainable consumption, helping businesses to minimise the carbon intensity of their supply chains, recovering 90% of all waste generated and reducing the consumption of carbon-intensive foods.
The Amsterdam Circular Strategy 2020-2025. This strategy sets out a vision to transition Amsterdam to a circular economy, with a goal of becoming 100% circular, and to halve the use of primary resources in the city by 2030. It targets three of Amsterdam’s biggest consumption emissions sectors: food consumption and organic waste, consumer goods and the built environment. It was informed by and published alongside Amsterdam’s ‘city doughnut’ (see box).
The 2021 San Francisco Climate Action Plan. This is among the most comprehensive and ambitious climate action plans targeting consumption and sector-based emissions to date. It aims for a 40% reduction in consumption-based emissions by 2030 and an 80% cut by 2050, as well as sector-based emissions reductions (below 1990 levels) of 61% by 2030 and 90% by 2040. San Francisco’s CBEI informed the ‘Responsible production and consumption’ section of the plan.
Doughnut economics and the ‘city doughnut’
Doughnut economics is a model of economic development that aims to enable everyone to enjoy a minimum standard of living while respecting the limits of planetary boundaries.6 It is about more than consumption-based emissions, but provides an approach for governments at all levels to consider and reduce their impact on emissions beyond their administrative boundaries. Doughnut Economics: Cities and regions guide explains key principles and nine pathways for using it at city level.
Economist Kate Raworth, who developed the model, explains the concept in her TED talk A healthy economy should be designed to thrive, not grow. You can hear from Kate and the Leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, about how the city is applying Doughnut Economics in the Earth gets left off the balance sheet episode of How to save a planet – listen below, or wherever you get your podcasts.

The Thriving Cities Initiative worked with Philadelphia, Portland and Amsterdam to downscale the doughnut economics approach to the city level, developing the City Portrait tool, which is available to any city with an interest in taking this approach. The tool provides a holistic snapshot of the city and its impact through four lenses – social, ecological, local and global – providing new perspectives on what it means for a city to thrive.
Work with a diverse group of stakeholders to shape the city’s vision and approach
Reducing emissions from consumption requires change at every level, from structural interventions in supply chains and industries to individual choices. Partnerships with a wide range of public, private and non-profit organisations are therefore critical to effective action. Work with those stakeholders to develop a shared vision for the city’s approach to shifting to sustainable consumption, as well as to design, implement and monitor action.
The Thriving Cities Initiative’s City Portrait Canvas is a workshop tool designed to help cities to foster the big-picture thinking and group discussion needed to shape a local vision for sustainable consumption. How to engage stakeholders for powerful and inclusive climate action planning provides more advice and tools for collaborative planning.
Partners should include:
National and regional governments. Cities need to push national and regional governments to take bolder action and work with them where national regulations can advance city policies. Working with coalitions of other cities and stakeholders may help to advocate for change. Also read the Global Covenant of Mayors’ guide to multilevel action.
Private sector. Work with businesses and trade bodies to set bold targets, design effective and workable regulations, develop new solutions, introduce certification schemes for sustainable practices and understand the latest green innovations from the private sector.7
Civil society. Partnerships with non-governmental organisations, community groups, trade networks and media can help to raise awareness, build support and momentum, supply useful insights and research, and provide independent scrutiny of progress from industry.8
Residents. Public awareness campaigns and behavioural change initiatives targeting residents and communities are vital in sectors where consumption emissions depend on individual choices, such as food. As well as offering health and cost benefits, these actions give residents and groups that are highly motivated to address their climate footprint an opportunity to take direct action.
Introduce tried-and-tested policies in key consumption areas – and innovate
The most significant consumption-based emissions sectors that urban policymakers should focus on are buildings and infrastructure, food, waste, private transport, aviation, textiles, electronics and household appliances.9 As well as directly reducing the city’s consumption emissions, policies that demand or encourage the consumption of lower-carbon products and materials can help develop the market for them locally and beyond the city’s borders. Equally, the cross-border nature of consumption emissions means innovation and collaboration is needed between states and cities, suppliers and consumers, to develop solutions.
There are two broad categories of action that cities can take:10
Action to reduce the carbon intensity of products and materials. Many products and materials can be produced with lower embedded emissions, for example, by using lower-carbon materials and processes and through greater efficiencies and less waste along the supply chain.
Action to shift consumer choice toward more sustainable options. This means encouraging a shift to different, lower-carbon products, services and activities (such as eating more plant-based food and less meat, or shifting spending from high-carbon material goods to local culture and leisure activities), as well as reducing the consumption of new products altogether (for instance, by enabling repairs and a more circular economy).
Action to reduce emissions from urban consumption is still in infancy in most cities, but we describe below emerging and tried-and-tested approaches in key sectors that can inform your city’s strategy, with links to further resources. The two biggest urban consumption-based emissions sectors are food and the construction of buildings and infrastructure – accounting for 13% and 11% of consumption emissions, respectively, based on research for C40 member cities.11
Encourage a shift to healthy, sustainable diets
The food system that satisfies urban consumption is a huge global emitter and one of the biggest drivers of environmental change. Roughly 75% of food emissions stem from the consumption of animal-sourced food.12
The Planetary Health Diet is an evidence-based diet set out by the EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, Health as being optimal for human health and environmental sustainability. It involves eating lots of fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes and smaller amounts of meat, fish and dairy, and is designed to be adapted for local cultures and tastes.
At the same time, every city is home to people who lack sufficient access to food, as well as many who eat an unhealthy diet that contributes to obesity, premature death and rising healthcare costs. This is why city action to encourage a shift to a locally appropriate Planetary Health Diet offers huge benefits for both people and city budgets, as well as the climate.
Read How cities can support access to healthy, sustainable food for advice and examples of actions cities can take to improve diets, including transforming menus in public buildings such as schools, making healthy food easily accessible in every neighbourhood, banning fast-food advertising and encouraging retailers and restaurants to promote healthier meals. How cities can use procurement to shift towards sustainable food consumption explores ways to leverage municipal purchasing power. In Focus: Addressing food-related consumption-based emissions in C40 Cities provides an in-depth look at food and food waste in leading cities. Find more resources on sustainable diets in our library.
Examples of actions from leading cities include Quezon City’s ordinance prohibiting the sale of junk foods and sugary drinks by shops and canteens in or near schools, requiring them to sell nutritious food instead, and Los Angeles’ Healthy Neighborhood Market Network programme, which supports small business owners in low-income neighbourhoods in bringing good food to their communities.
Reduce food waste to cut unnecessary demand for food production
A third of all food produced for human consumption worldwide is either lost or wasted, squandering not just the food itself but also the labour, water, energy, land and other resources that went into producing it.13 Cities can reduce waste by municipal canteens, as well as by households and businesses.
As well as reducing the volume of food that is lost and wasted, cities should collect and treat residual waste to create new resources for sale and/or local consumption – creating a more circular system. Our food-waste articles for cities with relatively advanced waste systems and cities earlier on the path to sustainable waste management explain how. Avoid new incineration projects, as they lock in demand for high waste volumes.
Transition to clean construction of buildings and infrastructure
Construction is responsible for around 23% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.14 The production of cement, a key ingredient in concrete, is alone responsible for 8% of all global CO2 emissions. At the city level, construction is the second biggest source (11%) of consumption-based emissions for C40 member cities; embodied emissions account for 20-50% of the whole-life emissions of an average building.15 Construction output is also growing rapidly ‒ by 2050, another 2.5 billion people are expected to live in urban areas and accommodating them means constructing buildings and infrastructure equivalent to a city the size of Milan (1.5 million people) every week.16, 17 For these reasons and more, the construction of buildings and infrastructure is a critical sector.
City governments can lead with municipal buildings and construction projects, as well as provide the long-term vision and regulatory context needed to transition to clean construction practices locally, and to influence supply chains.18
Starting with the most impactful approaches, this means actions to repurpose and upgrade existing buildings to bring them into more active use, to develop the deconstruction industry and avoid demolishing buildings, to use materials efficiently, to switch to low-carbon and re-used materials, to ensure new construction is designed for adaptability, flexible use and the recovery of materials, and to transition to zero-emission construction sites.

Vancouver is targeting embodied emissions in buildings
Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Response 2019 targets a 40% reduction in the emissions embodied in new buildings and construction projects by 2030 (from a 2018 baseline) as one of six ‘Big Moves’. To meet this target, Vancouver is working to use materials more efficiently, reuse existing buildings and materials, build more from sustainably sourced wood and mass timber, use lower-carbon blends of concrete and put less parking (and the associated concrete) in buildings, among other things.19
Reduce the use of disposable, single-use plastics
The growth of takeaway services and delivery for food and other goods has led to immense amounts of single-use packaging, cups, food containers and other items being disposed of in cities – much of it plastic. Globally, around 36% of all plastics produced are single-use.20 Plastics are commonly projected to be the biggest source – or even the only real source – of new demand for oil in the coming decades, so the oil industry sees an opportunity to invest in and push more plastic.21 If plastic demand is allowed to grow as projected, it would use an estimated 19% of the entire remaining global carbon budget.22
As major consumers of single-use plastics, cities have a critical role to play in restraining and reducing demand. Reusable options are already well developed and widely available in the food sector, offering a starting point that many cities are already taking. How to reduce single-use plastics in the food sector explains more.
Implement targeted actions to reduce other major sources of local consumption emissions
Prioritise other actions to target key local consumption sectors, ideally informed by the consumption-based emissions inventory. Impactful and widely applicable actions are:
Reducing the ownership of private vehicles. The operation of private vehicles is a leading source of local emissions, air pollution, congestion, noise and traffic danger in cities. The production of private vehicles – including electric vehicles ‒ creates significant emissions too, outside of city boundaries. How to drive a modal shift from private vehicles to public transport, walking and cycling introduces ways to do this in your city.
Reducing the number of flights taken by residents. Cities can formally oppose the expansion of local airports, lobby the national government to strengthen rail networks and improve rail journeys, and advocate for cleaner air journeys, as Paris is doing, for example.23
Optimising the lifetime of electronics and other household appliances. Grow the local industry for goods repair and reuse, working with businesses, non-profits and volunteers which are already active in this space. Cities can support community repair events, offer voucher schemes, establish city-run repair, reuse and ‘lending library’ facilities, and leverage municipal procurement, for example, as well as advocate for Right to Repair and other supportive legislation. How to grow your city’s reuse and repair economy explains more.
Reducing the number of new clothes, footwear and other textile products that consumers buy, as well as cutting waste in the supply chain. Cities can help to foster a local culture and industry for second-hand clothes, work with businesses to develop solutions and to scale initiatives, and support existing small and medium enterprises in this sector. Glasgow is doing this as part of the Glasgow Circular Economy Route Map, which establishes a vision for an alternative economy based on fixing and sharing as a way to stimulate civic participation.

Cities around the world are building better financial strategies. At the heart of this transition lies a strategic reallocation of investments away from high-emitting activities and into clean energy and other climate-friendly industries. This move is prudent from a financial standpoint, as well as aligned with climate goals – investment portfolios excluding fossil fuels have delivered superior returns over the past decade, while fossil fuel investments are increasingly risky.1 This article sets out how cities can get started with moving their investments to manage risk and grasp the opportunities presented by the transition to a low carbon economy.
This looks at the reallocation of investments held by the city and its employees, for example through city pension funds. While this can increase funds for the delivery of the city’s own climate measures, for the most part this shift supports sustainable industries at large. Read 6 ways to drive climate investment for routes to paying for the city’s climate projects, programmes and investments.
Make a public commitment to divest from fossil fuels and scale up investment in sustainable solutions
Political commitment from the city’s senior leadership is essential, sending a strong message to asset managers and other stakeholders and generating public interest. Make it binding, or as difficult to reverse as possible, for example by passing a motion, integrating commitments in the city’s climate action plan and other relevant strategies, and publishing a long-term divestment plan with clear goals, deadlines and measurable interim targets. The approach will vary depending on the governing structure of city pension funds and the municipal assets currently invested in fossil fuels, among other factors.
The shift from investment in fossil fuels toward sustainable solutions takes time and is implemented gradually, requiring continued progress and commitment across successive city administrations. Often, cities first commit to divesting from fossil fuels (or remaining fossil free, if the city doesn’t currently have fossil fuel holdings), and the commitment to increase sustainable investment and achieve a net-zero investment portfolio may come later.
Consider joining international commitments to gain further visibility and recognition, and to learn from and inspire peers in other cities. Cities (and/or their pension funds) can consider joining or becoming signatories to:
The Paris Aligned Asset Owner (PAAO) Commitment, an outcome of the Paris Aligned Investment Initiative (PAII), which was established in 2019 as an investor-led forum to support investors to align their portfolios and investment activities to the goals of the Paris Agreement. This is the most city-relevant of the eight alliances under the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global coalition of leading financial institutions committed to accelerating the decarbonisation of the economy.
C40 Cities Divest-Invest Forum and Accelerator. Led by London, the forum is a first-of-its-kind initiative helping urban leaders make the leap to effective divestment and accelerated green investment. The Accelerator is a public commitment made by the mayor (or equivalent city leadership). Joining is open to any city, regardless of C40 membership. The 2023 Accelerator Report sets out activities and progress made by signatories.
New York City pension funds’ path from fossil fuel holdings toward a net-zero investment portfolio
A goal set in 2018 by three City of New York pension funds – NYC Employee’s Retirement System (NYCERS), Teachers’ Retirement System (TRS) and Board of Education Retirement System (BERS) – to divest from fossil fuel reserve owners within five years, consistent with fiduciary duty, was achieved by 2022. Together they divested around US $4 billion. They have since committed to achieving net zero GHG emissions across the investment portfolio by 2040, with interim delivery dates for ramping up climate solutions in 2025 and 2035. In 2023 all three adopted Net Zero Implementation Plans in alignment with the recommendations and considerations set out by the United Nations High Level Expert Group on the Net Zero Commitments of Non-State Entities.2 All three are also signatories to the PAAO Commitment.3 Through a climate budgeting process, and linked to New York’s Climate Action Plan, the city is currently developing new tools to assess the environmental benefits of its investments.
Shift municipal assets and investments from fossil fuels to sustainable solutions
Your city administration may hold a range of investments on its balance sheet, including cash equivalents, trusts, and longer-term fixed income and equity investments. The city can lead by example by addressing its own investments in fossil fuel companies and adjacent industries, prior to engaging actors such as city pension funds. Moving toward sustainable options can also help to raise funds for climate measures in the city itself, for example by ensuring that more of the city’s bond issuance is ‘green’.
This will require collaboration between many departments across the city administration, including the finance department and that leading the city’s climate action planning and implementation, among others. For instance, the city’s finance team, treasury and/or others as relevant will need to assess the exposure of the city’s investments to fossil fuel companies. Sponsorship or business engagement teams should assess any partnerships with fossil fuel companies, such as related trade associations. Takes steps to ensure strong relationships, common goals and understanding between departments. Consider establishing a divestment working group, or creating a new department/empowering an existing department to become a focal point for sustainable investment.
The divestment strategy for municipal investments may take either, or a mixture, of the following approaches:
A rules-based approach. This means that cities define which types of fossil fuel companies and business activities should be excluded from municipal investments. Investments are either banned completely, or a percentage threshold is set for business revenue from fossil fuel activities, above which investment is prohibited.
A principles-based (or stewardship) approach. This involves assessing portfolio companies according to the extent to which they are exposed to climate risks and their preparedness for and progress in supporting a low-carbon economy.
Make use of assessment frameworks and resources to identify companies to exclude from municipal investments:
The Transition Pathway Initiative is a global initiative led by asset owners to support asset managers and investor commitments to align portfolios with net zero. It offers an independent, authoritative assessment of the progress made by over 1,000 publicly listed equities. This is what the London Pensions Fund Authority uses to assess whether companies are taking sufficient meaningful action to remain in the investment portfolio.4
The Carbon Underground 200 is a list of the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies ranked by the size of their fossil fuel reserves.
The Net Zero Investment Framework provides investors and asset owners with a common framework, timeline and metrics, for delivering on Paris-aligned climate goals. This is the core publication of the PAII – signatories of the PAAO are expected to use it – and is currently the most implemented net zero methodology for investors within the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).5 The Brunel Pension Partnership, responsible for Bristol City Council and other worker pensions, is one of many to use this framework to signal and guide their selective divestment action.
Create or adopt a sustainable investment framework or finance taxonomy to provide clarity on what constitutes a ‘sustainable’ or ‘climate’ investment. While aimed at the national level, the World Bank guide to developing green finance taxonomies offers relevant advice, especially for emerging economies.
Oslo Pensjonsforsikring, the pension fund owned by the city, created a rule to divest from all coal companies and set a carbon footprint reduction target for the remainder of its portfolio, leading to divestment from other fossil fuel companies and large greenhouse gas emitters. The fund’s policy on coal companies opened the door to further conversation with the city on routes to sustainable investment practices.
Copenhagen’s municipal investment policy established a rule for the city fund to screen out all companies earning more than 5% of revenue from coal, oil, and gas prospecting, extraction, refining, and equipment and services, as well as utilities that derive more than 50% of capacity from coal. Meanwhile, a minimum of 50% of the city’s equity investments must be ‘sustainable’ as classified by the Europe Union’s Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). By 2025, 27% of Copenhagen’s investments in bonds must be ‘green bonds’, up from 19% by 2023.6
In Auckland, good internal cooperation between the sustainability and treasury teams enabled the city to develop mutually-beneficial divestment criteria for the city’s ‘rainy day fund’ (now evolved into the city’s Future Fund), creating a revised Responsible Investment Policy with specific provisions around fossil fuel divestment that was passed by the council. Auckland has since aligned loan eligibility criteria with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The Sustainable Finance Framework, created in 2023, identifies the sectors and assets that are eligible for green bonds and loans. Nature-based solutions are among those established as loan eligible. Watch the C40 Cities Divest-Invest Forum webinar Investing in urban nature-based solutions to hear Helen Mahoney, Group Sustainable Finance Manager at Auckland Council, share the city’s experience.
Engage city pension funds and other investors
Municipal employee pensions funds and those responsible for the pension fund savings of other public sector workers represent huge sums of capital. Through engagement with these funds, cities help to shift significant capital away from fossil fuel companies and towards a clean energy, climate safe future.
Use appropriate channels to engage with pension fund management
In most cities, municipal employee pension funds are legally independent bodies, separate from the city administration. Pension savings for municipal employees may be grouped with others and held at the state/provincial or national level. Engagement strategies will be shaped by the structure of your city pensions and the relationship between the city and the fund.
Where the mayor or equivalent can elect members of the fund’s Board of Trustees, the city should take the opportunity to ensure professionals with an understanding of climate risk are involved in investment decision-making by the fund. In most cases, relationships will need to be built or strengthened. Cities can begin by asking pension fund trustees about the proportion of fossil fuel and sustainable assets in their portfolio, the asset classes held, about their assessment of investment risks and opportunities across different asset classes, and can call for the development of routes toward possible divestment pathways and/or fossil free investment options, for example.
Existing environmental risk policies can offer a springboard to start discussions with pension funds. Cities may request that these are updated to ensure sufficient consideration and management of climate-related physical risks (such as flood risk for real estate investments) and transition risks (such as the potential for a rapid decline in the value of carbon intensive assets).
In 2020, Mayor of Vancouver Kennedy Stewart wrote to the British Columbia Municipal Pension Plan requesting a risk assessment of the plan’s investments based on carbon exposure, and information about steps being taken to measure and mitigate these risks. The same year, the board approved a three-year strategic plan prioritising addressing climate risk to the investment portfolio, and setting goals reduce the portfolio’s carbon intensity 55% by 2030 on route to a net-zero portfolio by 2050. The Municipal Pension Plan was already among the first large pension plans in Canada to voluntarily report climate-related financial disclosures according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), starting in the 2019 Annual Report.
Be clear that the case for divestment and sustainable investment is strong
Pension fund trustees’ first and foremost priority is to fulfil their legal duty to act in the best interest of the investors whose savings they are responsible for (their fiduciary duty). Cities can play a role in raising awareness of the main arguments, which we explain in Why divest-invest action pays off. In summary, these are:
Divestment can be consistent with fiduciary duties. Fossil fuel companies are increasingly risky enterprises, and most are ill-prepared to meet future challenges.7, 8 Even despite significant price increases in 2020 and 2021, investments in the fossil fuel sector have devalued over the last decade. In 2023 the fossil fuel sector posted an annual loss of 5%, and oil majors reported a 30% decline in annual profits.9 Decarbonising portfolios is an obvious way to mitigate these risks in line with fiduciary duties. Meanwhile, fossil free portfolios have been proven to perform better than portfolios including fossil fuels, and failure to invest in fast-growing sectors could be a missed opportunity.10 Analysis from Corporate Knights in 2018 showed New York State Common Retirement Fund would have been an estimated $22.2 billion richer had it decided to divest its fossil fuel stocks ten years previously.
“The era of stable, blue-chip returns from the fossil fuel sector is long gone. Now, every major investment house has developed investment products with sustainable mandates. These mandates reflect the fossil fuel sector’s underperformance, its negative long-term outlook, and increasing demand for investment products with dramatically less or no fossil fuels. Over the last decade, shedding oil, gas, and coal has proven a winning financial strategy.”
Dan Cohn, IEEFA energy finance analyst and co-author of Passive investing in a warming world (2024)
Sustainable investment opportunities are on the rise, and a fossil free portfolio can be well-diversified. The World Economic Forum estimates that the total value of the climate solutions supply chain will reach between $5 trillion and $11 trillion by 2030, with the biggest opportunities in mature solutions offering readily investable opportunities – notably electricity networks, sustainable vehicles, wind, solar, and building heating solutions.11
Develop a system for monitoring and reporting
City staff can play an important role in keeping up pressure and momentum for pension fund divestment, seeking regular reporting on progress. For example Toronto City Council’s Infrastructure and Environment Committee have invited the province-level employee pension scheme, OMERS, to make an annual presentation on their climate action plan and requested more detail in the plan and progress reporting.
How to Divest Invest: A guide for institutional investors provides pathways for institutional investors that may provide helpful scenarios to discuss with the pension fund trustees at the start of the process.
How to disclose your city’s climate-related financial risks provides more information on the framework set out by the International Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, which helps cities to ensure climate risk is adequately considered, monitored and mitigated.
Work with advocacy groups and other stakeholders to build momentum and communicate progress
The proliferation of divestment campaigns in cities across the globe means that many city administrations and pension funds will already be under pressure to divest. Local campaigns for fossil fuel divestment can be a valuable source of support and information. Many campaigns have a strong social media presence and communications teams who can help to amplify or collaborate on announcements, validate the action taken, and build it into a positive political moment. Go Fossil Free offers a directory to check for campaigns in your area. Experts at 350.org explain more in Your local divestment campaign groups are valuable assets. Work with them.
Glasgow City Council’s engagement with the city’s main divestment campaigning body, Divest Strathclyde, began when they were invited take part in the council’s Climate Emergency Working Group in 2019. Fossil fuel divestment was among the group’s recommendations. In 2021, the city council passed a motion and launched a plan to shed Strathclyde Pension Fund’s £500 million holdings in fossil fuel companies, which was loudly celebrated by Divest Strathclyde. As well as having its employees covered by the fund, Glasgow City Council is the fund administrator.12, 13
The publication of New York City pension funds’ plan to achieve net zero investment portfolio was accompanied by a press release with comment from the prominent divestment campaigner and 350.org founder, Bill McKibben, and Chair of the UN’s High-Level Expert Group on the Net Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities, Catherine McKenna, among others.
Other key groups to engage are:
Private investors and other businesses. Consider presenting at events aimed at private investors to advocate for action, or request meetings between city and business leaders.
Higher levels of government. This is particularly important where pension funds are governed at national or state/provincial level.
Other major employers and institutions in the city. Many universities, cultural and health institutions, for example, are already divesting from fossil fuels or are under pressure to do so. Working with them can help to build momentum and support divestment activities by all parties. University of California’s chief investment officer and treasurer shares experience in Our investments are going fossil free - but not for the reasons you may think.
Other local municipal bodies. Working with local councils and districts to share experience and expertise can multiply the impact of action.
Other cities. Work with other city signatories to the international commitments listed earlier, and consider bilateral action with city partners. For example, the mayors of Boston and London published a joint op-ed in the New Statesman ahead of the UN General Assembly in 2023, highlighting transatlantic divestment action, the importance of scaling up investment in local climate resilience, and calling on others to do the same.
London was among the first cities to drive efforts to divest its pension funds from fossil fuels. In 2017, a year after Mayor Sadiq Khan took office, London Pension Fund Authority (LPFA, totalling £8 billion) agreed to a climate change policy and in 2018 the mayor called on and offered support to London’s 32 boroughs to divest pension funds from fossil fuels. LPFA successfully removed the last extractive fossil fuel investments from its listed equity portfolio in 2022, and has published a plan to achieve a net zero portfolio by 2050 or sooner.14 Thirteen boroughs have so far taken some degree of divestment action.

Globally, the construction industry consumes over a third of all extracted resources each year. When buildings are demolished most of their materials go straight to landfill, wasting vast quantities of valuable resources and driving up financial and environmental costs. Deconstruction offers a means of salvaging materials for reuse. It also creates more jobs than demolition, spurs local innovation and industry, preserves local character and heritage, reduces landfill costs and limits the need for virgin (and often carbon-intensive) materials. Even better, cites can introduce policies that foster the repurposing of existing buildings to meet new needs, doing away with the need to remove them at all. This article explains how.
Prioritise adapting and reusing existing assets and buildings first
Repurposing buildings for new uses, or ‘adaptive reuse’, does away with the need for building removal and is the most sustainable, least disruptive and often cheapest way to respond to evolving needs while preserving a building’s character. Adaptive reuse should be promoted except where buildings or infrastructure are too derelict, pose irreparable structural dangers or present other challenges that can’t be addressed. How to reduce embodied emissions in municipal construction and lead by example and How to reduce embodied emissions in private and residential buildings give guidance on how to promote adaptive reuse in municipal and private buildings respectively.
Set plans, strategies and targets for deconstruction and materials reuse
Targets for construction and demolition waste minimisation and material reuse should be embedded in city plans, such as those on climate action, waste management and urban development. Strategies should follow the ‘construction hierarchy’, prioritising the adaptive reuse of existing buildings, followed by the deconstruction of structures that must be removed alongside measures to create a thriving secondary market for these materials. Cities can also develop targets, informed by evidence of local deconstruction opportunities and costs, for the number or percentage of buildings to be deconstructed and/or the quantity of materials that should be recovered from deconstructed buildings.
Good examples include:
The London Plan states that Circular Economy Statements are to be submitted for all strategic planning applications, recognising the benefits of a low carbon circular economy to London’s economic success. It identifies large-scale developments as presenting the greatest opportunities for innovative building design that avoids waste, supports high recycling rates and helps to minimise waste.
Amsterdam Circular Economy Implementation Plan 2023–2026 sets out how the city will change patterns of material use and stimulate the use of circular and bio-based construction materials, such as cellulose, flax and cattail for insulation. Other measures include extending the lifespan of buildings and infrastructural assets, ensuring urban planning projects conform with circular design principles, and circular criteria in procurement for all municipal assets, renovations and maintenance.
Boulder City Council approved mandates, effective 2020, to divert 75% of home and commercial structure removal waste from landfills.
The Paris Climate Action Plan sets a target for 30% of office space construction to be reversible by 2030, rising to 50% by 2050.
The Portland and Multnomah County Climate Action Plan incorporates actions to: promote alternatives to traditional building demolition, such as relocation, deconstruction and salvage, including identifying and removing barriers and disincentives; provide technical assistance and resources to contractors to meet Portland’s construction and demolition debris requirements, giving priority to salvage and reuse activities; increase material salvage for city-owned building demolitions; support the use of regional, sustainably sourced wood products for city-owned building and landscape projects, including training for contractors; and develop a sustainable consumption strategy to prioritise local-government activities to support a shift to lower-carbon consumption patterns.
The Oakland 2030 Equitable Climate Action Plan includes actions to: establish a deconstruction requirement; support the reuse, repair, recovery and refurbishment economy; and reduce lifecycle emissions from building materials.
The Beaverton Climate Action Plan includes an action to develop a deconstruction and salvage policy.
The St. Paul Climate Action & Resilience Plan, which includes the adoption of a deconstruction/diversion ordinance to require the reuse/recycling of construction materials.
Vancouver’s Zero Waste 2040 plan establishes the reduction of waste from construction and demolition as a priority action. This is integrated into the city’s Green Demolition By-Law.
Johannesburg’s Green Building Policy aims to achieve low to net zero carbon performance for all new buildings by 2030. Connected to this, the Waste Management Plan commits to diverting at least 30% of construction waste (by mass) from landfill by recycling or reusing materials and to reusing or recycling at least 50% of demolition waste.
Undertake a cost-benefit analysis of deconstruction, building material reuse and design for disassembly in the city
Such an analysis, while not critical, is useful to inform locally relevant policy development and public and private investment, particularly if targets are being set. Good examples include Auckland’s Cost Benefit Analysis of Construction and Demolition Waste Diversion from Landfill, led by Auckland Council, and The Economics of Residential Building Deconstruction in Portland, OR, led by Portland State University.
Involve a wide range of stakeholders in the planning and implementation of deconstruction policies
A deconstruction advisory group might include, for example, representatives from builders and developers, neighbourhood groups, urban development, historic preservation, salvage/deconstruction (non-profit and retailers), waste, recycling and permitting.
Develop the local deconstruction market with municipal procurement, collaboration and training
Cities can use their purchasing power to advance the city’s capacity for deconstruction and building-materials reuse, both directly and indirectly, developing a local deconstruction industry.
Require pre-demolition audits and salvage assessment for all city projects. Pre-demolition audits will help to ensure the recovery of recyclable materials. Salvage assessments identify useable materials in a building, raising awareness and providing an incentive to deconstruct rather than demolish. Salvage assessments also help to build an understanding of the secondary materials that may soon be on the market. For example, Copenhagen requires an analysis of building elements suitable for reuse before any city-owned building is demolished or renovated. Seattle requires that construction and demolition permit applicants complete a Salvage Assessment for whole-building demolition projects, as well as projects that involve alterations valued above $75,000 and/or where the area of work is greater than 750 square feet.
Intercept the municipal waste stream to salvage reusable materials. Salvaging reusable materials before they go to landfill can be cost-neutral for cities, as in the case of Berkley, California. Berkley pays local reuse company Urban Ore a salvage service fee, which matches the landfill waste fee, to extract reusable items and materials from the city-owned transfer station before they are taken to landfill. Read the contract or watch Urban Ore’s operations manager explain the arrangement. San Diego’s Sustainable Building Policy establishes measures for city-owned, occupied or leased new construction and major renovations. The measures focus on incorporating recycled building products, using local materials, and reducing the use of finite raw and long-cycle renewable materials by replacing them with rapidly renewable materials.
Support workforce deconstruction training. Consider partnering with relevant local non- or for-profit organisations to do this, such as salvage operations, motivated construction companies and neighbourhood groups. San Mateo County in California offers deconstruction training and contracts a building-materials reuse warehouse to support reuse in the San Francisco Bay Area. Portland, Oregon requires work to be done by certified deconstruction contractors and provides workforce training and certification grants, working with national membership organisation Build Reuse. Vienna is training long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged workers to deconstruct large industrial buildings. Baltimore, Maryland has teamed up with local non-profits to invest in its deconstruction industry as a means of generating employment and managing its abandoned buildings. This 15-minute video explains more.

Harness neighbourhood activism
Work with any neighbourhood groups working against the demolition of buildings to inform, build support for and raise awareness of deconstruction policies. These groups typically focus on older buildings with historical value or character, which are often a rich source of reusable material and more straightforward to demolish than newer buildings, depending on the city’s building traditions. Stop Demolishing Portland is one example.
Promote voluntary deconstruction with grants and permitting incentives
Grants and incentives that increase the voluntary use of deconstruction as an alternative to demolition reduce the cost of establishing a deconstruction industry and secondary material market in the city. They also enable the collection of local data and good-practice examples, build capacity within the salvage industry and raises awareness of the benefits and opportunities. Voluntary programmes are a useful first step on the path to a mandatory deconstruction ordinance.
The main approaches are:
Building-scale grants. Portland’s deconstruction grant programme provided up to USD 3,000 for deconstruction projects from 2015-2016, ahead of the mandatory ordinance (see box). In Hennepin County, Minnesota, homeowners and developers of residential properties can apply for grants of up to USD 5,000 (USD 2 per square foot) to offset any additional time and labour costs involved in deconstruction, provided the building exceeds 500 square feet and was built before 1970, alongside other eligibility requirements.
Grants for businesses and non-profits to incorporate waste reduction into their operations. In Alameda County, California, non-profit and for-profit organisations can apply for Reuse & Repair Grants of up to USD 20,000 from county agency StopWaste to fund projects that incorporate reuse, repair, deconstruction and other waste-reduction activities.
Require an analysis of deconstruction opportunities or a salvage assessment as part of permit applications for building removal projects. This analysis will show the building owner and the city which building elements are suitable for reuse, raising awareness of deconstruction opportunities and enabling cities to encourage or require their uptake. Singapore’s Demolition Protocol (DP) helps contractors better plan demolition procedures to maximise the recovery of waste materials for reuse or recycling, and has been incorporated into SS 557 Code of Practice for Demolition. DP includes pre-demolition audit, sequential demolition and site waste management. The protocol has led to the development of new materials like recycled concrete aggregate (RCA), which is made up of more than 70% demolition waste.
Expedited and/or reduced costs for permitting. Expediting permitting for deconstruction encourages deconstruction and offsets for additional time involved relative to demolition. Cities can also refund initial costs for permitting once a predetermined threshold of salvaged material has been achieved, potentially connected to landfill diversion thresholds.1
Cities can also encourage or require deconstruction projects to place signage with positive messaging about deconstruction on the site to raise awareness about the local benefits and opportunities.
Promote ‘design for disassembly’ to make future deconstruction projects easier
Design for disassembly (DfD) (or ‘reversible construction’) facilitates the recovery of products, parts and materials from buildings constructed today when a building is renovated or deconstructed in future. It involves developing the assemblies, components, materials, construction techniques and information and management systems required. This guide explains what DfD means in practice.
City governments can promote the adoption of these practices by providing locally appropriate guidance on DfD, requiring DfD for public projects and through permitting incentives, for example.
Establish or support local marketplaces for material reuse
Materials reuse works most effectively when there is a local second-hand market, whether physical and/or digital, and deconstruction specialists which can provide usable construction materials. Examples include:
The award-winning Materials Marketplace established by Austin connects businesses and organisations so that they can identify reuse and recycling opportunities. The Marketplace is an online platform which connects businesses and organisations to connect and find reuse and recycling solutions for waste and by-product materials and is part of Austin’s plan to reach zero waste by 2040.
Vancouver has a rebuild hub that takes and resells donated materials. The hub has seen greatest demand for used timber.
Oslo opened a hub for reuse of building materials in 2023. It is geared towards professional actors in the construction sector, aiming to build a business model for reused building materials (it does not take donations). It also includes a knowledge centre on reuse in the construction centre.
Adopt a mandatory deconstruction ordinance
A deconstruction ordinance should specify the types of building or sectors affected and establish a timeline for an incremental increase in requirements. It is important to have a consultation process prior to developing an ordinance to understand the concerns of key actors and to develop appropriate support and incentives.
Require deconstruction for priority segments of the city’s building stock. The building types prioritised should be based on an assessment of those most likely to yield reusable materials and other local priorities, such as the preservation of historical features. This is the approach that Portland, Oregon has taken (see box below). Requirements can be expanded to additional segments at a later date.
Ban demolition entirely, for all buildings. Palo Alto’s ordinance, adopted in 2019 and effective July 2020, bans demolition and requires deconstruction for all commercial and residential buildings identified for removal. The ordinance is part of the city’s Climate Action Plan and subsequent Zero Waste Plan, which aim for 95% of waste to be diverted from landfill by 2030. Approximately 40% of Palo Alto’s waste is from construction and demolition projects.2 San Francisco’s 2006 Construction & Demolition (C&D) ordinance banned the direct disposal of any such material to landfill. The regulation was updated in 2018 to mandate third party verification of facilities receiving C&D materials for maximising recovery, and again in 2021 to tighten regulations by improving the tracking of material haulers. The city worked with a climate technology company to launch an online marketplace for reclaimed and surplus building materials for the Bay Area in 2023.
Portland, OR – the first city in the United States to adopt a mandatory deconstruction ordinance
There is strong demand for salvaged material in Portland, Oregon, thanks to a robust reuse culture and a local design aesthetic that favours salvaged materials (especially timber). The city has established for- and non-profit retail marketplaces, including the ReBuilding Center and Salvage Works.
In September 2015, Portland’s deconstruction grant programme began to provide up to USD 3,000 to qualifying builders, homeowners and deconstruction contractors. Twenty-four houses were fully deconstructed under the programme, at a total cost to the city of USD 50,000, paving the way for a deconstruction ordinance. The ordinance was adopted in 2016 through an amendment to the Buildings Law Code. It targeted houses and duplexes built before 1916 and historical buildings, which are a rich source of valuable old-growth lumber and relatively straightforward to deconstruct. Together, such buildings account for a third of the city’s housing stock – a sufficiently large segment to develop the market without overwhelming it. Success enabled the city to expand the ordinance in 2019 to include dwellings built before 1940 – an additional third of the city’s housing stock. Watch Mayor Ted Wheeler introduce this amendment at the City Council here or learn more from the leader of Portland’s Deconstruction Advisory Group here.
Update building codes to allow the use of salvaged and recycled materials in new structures
Work with experts and local, regional and national building-code officials to explicitly allow the reuse of materials in the building code, including the reuse of undamaged lumber without costly regrading. The code should also issue clear reuse guidance.
For example, the Washington State Building Code includes explicit support for the use of used sawn lumber for structural purposes, while the Oregon Residential Building Code allows lumber reuse without regrading. Updated in 2022, Mexico City’s environmental standard NACDMX-007-RNAT-2019 establishes specifications for the management of construction and demolition waste, through which the city requires the use of recycled material in public works. In 2022, over 92% of the total generated construction and demolition waste was used, a huge increase from 16% in 2021.
Set requirements to address hazardous dust pollution from demolition projects
Requirements that address hazardous dust pollution make demolition projects safer and can increase the attractiveness of deconstruction as an alternative, as they ensure significantly less dust and facilitate the safe disposal of hazardous materials. Requirements should target the hazardous materials that are prevalent locally. For example, to reduce the risks of lead-based paint and asbestos demolition dust, Portland, Oregon passed an ordinance adopting stringent lead-based paint removal and dust-control best practices for residential demolition.
Include deconstruction in planning for disaster recovery and managed retreat
Deconstruction and building-materials reuse has been shown to support community rebuilding and create jobs in the aftermath of a disaster. This is especially important when many people will have lost their livelihoods. It also supports the process of managed retreat from sea-level rise.
Deconstruction enables the recovery of personal belongings, historical artefacts, local resources and other valued elements of a community’s collective memory. It also limits further trauma and risk associated with the removal of damaged homes and structures, reduces disaster debris (and substantial landfill costs) and helps to meet demand for building materials for new structures.
Large-scale deconstruction following a disaster requires the presence of a local deconstruction industry. Cities at risk from destructive hazards and which have emerging or established deconstruction industries should include preparation for rapid roll-out of deconstruction training for local volunteers and contractors as part of disaster and/or adaptation plans. Cities considering a managed retreat as a means to adapt to rising sea levels should consider developing deconstruction to reduce distress and costs.
Deconstruction brings a ‘dignified end’ to a handful of homes in New Orleans
Large-scale deconstruction was never on the cards in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina owing to the absence of a deconstruction industry or policy that would have facilitated its development. More than 70% of New Orleans’ housing, or 275,000 homes, were destroyed or severely damaged by the hurricane, and the government ordered the demolition of all buildings damaged beyond 51% of their market value. In many cases, homes were demolished against the wishes of their owners and with little prior notice, causing further trauma and anxiety for those trying to rebuild.3
Nevertheless, a small Mercy Corps’-sponsored project enabled the deconstruction of nine buildings at a cost of USD 6,000 to USD 10,000 per house – in the range of federal payouts for demolition.4 Research shows huge benefits for those involved: the process brought relief by facilitating a ‘dignified end’ to people’s homes and, by proxy, to the lives they led before Katrina hit, thanks to positive social interaction in the process of deconstruction and material recovery. It allowed homeowners to reclaim valued objects and materials that would have been sent to landfill by federal mandate. By giving recovered material away, some of the participants reported a positive feeling akin to donating organs, ‘giving life to their critically injured community’ and to low-income residents.5
